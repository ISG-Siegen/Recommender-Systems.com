## Demo of RS_c's subdomain service 'Your-Project.Recommender-Systems.com'

At least for now, this is only a demo page to illustrate our free subdomain service [Your-Project.Recommender-Systems.com](https://Your-Project.Recommender-Systems.com). For selected projects, we offer a free sub-domain that can be used as a custom domain for GitHub pages. This recommender-systems.com subdomain can be used instead of the original GitHub URL. Fer instance, the original URL of the page you are currently looking at is  https://isg-siegen.github.io/Recommender-Systems.com. But, thanks to custom domains the actual domain now is https://code.recommender-systems-com.
